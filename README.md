# leetCodeSolutions
Worked out solutions for leetcode problems. Done primarily using c or c++.

All problems worked out independently but without time and space complexity optimizations, \
thus solution may be slower and/or take up more space on average. \

These solutions on their own will not run within a standard IDE, but will run if copy/pasted\
into the LeetCode IDE.
